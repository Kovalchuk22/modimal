                <p>Found throughout our collections, linen is a sustainable fiber made from the flax plant. Flax is naturally pest resistant that requires less pesticides, water and energy to produce compared to cotton and polyester. Flax aids in sequestering carbon into the soil, which removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and is beneficial for improving soil health.</p>

    <p class="material-text">We are continually exploring more sustainable alternatives that offer the same quality and performance. we will soon add new fabrics in to our collections which are recycling and repurposing. By giving a new life to leftover fabrics through recycling and repurposing, we can reduce our demand on the planet’s limited natural resources. Recycled fabrics are made using the waste from both the pre- and post-consumer stage of a product’s life. </p>
